                Green SF Now was honored to participate in Marshall Elementary School's Native American Heritage & Earth Day Celebration in San Francisco's Mission District. This vibrant cultural event brought together students and families for an afternoon of learning, art, food, and performances.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our team provided interactive art activities for students from kindergarten through 5th grade. We brought maps showing the existing city layout and historical waterways of San Francisco, inviting young artists to add their own creative interpretations directly on top. Many students chose to highlight the prehistoric waterways and green spaces that once characterized the area, while others envisioned new possibilities for their neighborhood. The youngest participants enjoyed using markers and crayons with Sierra Club "wildlife" coloring books.
              </p>
              <p>
                This hands-on approach proved to be an engaging way to help students connect with the natural history beneath San Francisco's built environment. By visualizing the historical waterways that once flowed freely through what is now an urban landscape, students gained a deeper understanding of how our city has evolved and how we might restore some of these natural elements in the future.

                A long-neglected underpass in Potrero Hill has blossomed into a vibrant green gateway, showcasing the power of neighborhood advocacy and sustainable urban design. Mayor Daniel Lurie joined Supervisor Shamann Walton, Donovan Lacy, Carla Short, Tilly Chang, and community leaders to celebrate the ribbon-cutting of the Potrero Gateway project — a transformation that turned a challenging stretch of urban infrastructure into a safe, green passageway.
                The project revitalized the Highway 101 underpass on 17th Street and the adjacent block of Vermont Street with widened sidewalks, protected bike lanes, and concrete dividers that create a safer environment for pedestrians and cyclists alike. As Supervisor Walton noted at the event, "This area was neglected—unsafe, uninviting, and overlooked. Today, we're celebrating a transformation that didn't start at City Hall but with neighbors who demanded better."
                What makes this project particularly exciting from a green infrastructure perspective is the thoughtful integration of ecology and art. Native plantings now soften the urban edges, while four striking public art sculptures titled "Metamorphosis" rise from terraced gardens.
                This project represents exactly the kind of transformation we champion at Green SF Now — community-led initiatives that replace hardscaped urban environments with green spaces that improve safety, build community, and reconnect us to the natural history beneath our city's concrete.</p>

              <p>Peter Belden and Kieran Farr represented Green SF Now at University of San Francisco's Earth Day celebration on Tuesday. Our table at Gleeson Plaza attracted students interested in local environmental initiatives, and our informative signage about Green Infrastructure sparked new conversations.
                We collected nearly 50 sign-ups and discovered many students hadn't yet encountered the Sierra Club. The Sierra Club Wildlife-themed coloring books were particularly popular among visitors.
                True to our green values, all materials were transported to campus by bicycle! Special thanks to USF's Office of Sustainability for organizing this celebration and providing the table and chairs, those are hard to bring on the bike.

                Our second activation at Treat Plaza transformed the space into a collaborative urban planning workshop. Karen Curtiss from Red Dot Studio Architecture and Design led a visioning exercise that engaged community members in reimagining green spaces throughout the Northeast Mission.
                Participants gathered around a detailed map of the neighborhood, adding their ideas via colorful post-it notes and markers while enjoying live mixed music from The DJ Project and art from Evolved SF and partners. The atmosphere was both productive and festive, with the historical exhibit "Treat: Past, Present, Future" providing context for the area's evolution and Sierra Club volunteers Elizabeth Creely, Parker Kjellin-Elder, and Vicky Hoover on hand to provide guidance and discussion.
                This participatory mapping approach allowed community members to identify potential sites for green infrastructure while considering the neighborhood's history and cultural heritage. Take a look at some of the feedback from this picture of the feedback here:

              <p>Cole Valley's innovative pop-up town square experiment transformed an awkward wedge of road into a lush urban garden. As the N Judah emerged from the tunnel, riders found over 500 plants creating an unexpected pocket of urban tranquility.
                I came early with my son and dad to to snap a few photos with organizer Luke Spray from the Green Street Fund and Robin Pam from KidSafeSF. The arrangement of tall plantings and other diverse greenery from Flora Grubb created natural safety barriers that allowed my kid to play comfortably without normal roadway hazards.
                This pop-up model presents an exciting new concept for quick, effective green activations across San Francisco!

                The official kickoff of San Francisco's 2025 Climate Action Plan Update brought together leaders across sectors at SF's War Memorial across from City Hall. Sierra Club members Kieran Farr, Vicky Hoover, Elizabeth Creely, Maya Chaffee, and Tom Radulovich from Livable City joined diverse stakeholders from community organizations, businesses, and government agencies to help shape our city's climate future.
                Our table focused on clean water systems and nature-based solutions. We explored how freshwater, stormwater, and wastewater infrastructure face increasing climate challenges, emphasizing the importance of working with nature rather than against it. Restoring wetlands and implementing natural solutions emerged as key strategies for climate adaptation.
                SF Environment Director Tyrone Jue set the tone by highlighting alarming trends: 2024 marked the hottest year on record, following record-breaking temperatures in 2023 and 2022. Mayor Daniel Lurie reaffirmed the city's commitment to net-zero emissions by 2040, spotlighting transportation and building operations as priority sectors comprising 89% of city emissions.
                Youth Commissioner Gabby Lester-Coll delivered a powerful speech on climate justice and youth involvement, reminding attendees that climate action isn't just about technology but about centering vulnerable communities in our solutions.

              <p>What a thrill to see SF New Deal's Building Blocks parklet program launch at Excelsior Coffee on a foggy Tuesday morning! The energy was electric as Lea Sabado and her son cut the ribbon on their bright yellow modular parklet, bringing "light green" infrastructure to life in the Excelsior District.
                As I chatted with Hoh Chen from SF New Deal, I was struck by how this Lego-inspired approach tackles both environmental and economic challenges. At just $400 monthly instead of the $60,000 upfront cost, these parklets are accessible to small businesses and community groups alike.
                The beauty of this system is how perfectly it aligns with our Green SF Now mission. These parklets are quintessential "light green" infrastructure, creating planted spaces that absorb rainwater, create community spaces, add biodiversity, and naturally calm traffic. The yellow sides of Excelsior Coffee's installation aren't just eye-catching; they're functional planters bringing nature back to our concrete corridors.</p>
