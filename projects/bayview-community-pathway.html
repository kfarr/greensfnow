            <h3>🌱 Project Overview</h3>
            <p>The Bayview Community Pathway is a direct result of community outreach through the <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/projects/bayview-community-based-transportation-plan" target="_blank">Bayview Community-Based Transportation Plan</a>. During past SFMTA planning efforts, Bayview residents communicated the need to improve safety and comfort for people walking and biking along, across, and parallel to Third Street, the main arterial in the Bayview neighborhood.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Third Street and Lane Street are both on the <strong>High Injury Network</strong>, the 12% of city streets where 68% of transportation-related severe and fatal injuries occur. Community members identified a low-stress neighborhood route parallel to Third Street as a critical transportation priority to improve access to community destinations including the Southeast Community Center, Bayview YMCA, parks, schools, libraries, grocery stores, and transit connections.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The project was developed with input from several community organizations through presentations and a walk audit as part of the Caltrans Active Transportation Program (ATP) application process, receiving <strong>$15.5 million in grant funding</strong>.</p>

          <h3>🌳 Green Infrastructure & Climate Resilience</h3>
          <p>A key component of the Bayview Community Pathway is the integration of green infrastructure through coordination with the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC). This project represents a significant opportunity to address stormwater management and climate resilience in the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Bioretention Planters:</strong> Install rain gardens and bioswales along the corridor to capture and filter stormwater runoff, reducing pollution entering the Bay and relieving pressure on the combined sewer system</li>
            <li><strong>Permeable Surfaces:</strong> Incorporate permeable paving materials where feasible to increase groundwater absorption and reduce urban heat island effects</li>
            <li><strong>Street Tree Expansion:</strong> Significantly increase tree canopy coverage along Mendell Street, McKinnon Avenue, Lane Street, Underwood Avenue, and Keith Street to provide shade, improve air quality, and create cooling corridors</li>
            <li><strong>Native Plants & Greenery:</strong> Select climate-appropriate plantings that support local ecosystems, require less water, and enhance the visual character of the African American Arts & Cultural District</li>
            <li><strong>SFPUC Partnership:</strong> Coordinate with SFPUC Green Infrastructure Capital Fund to maximize environmental benefits and ensure integration with citywide climate resilience goals</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-detail-card">
          <h3>🚴 Multimodal Transportation Improvements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Safety Infrastructure:</strong> Speed humps, sidewalk extensions, raised crosswalks, and traffic calming measures to create a safer corridor for people walking and biking</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural District Enhancement:</strong> Pedestrian-friendly public spaces for gathering and unique street markings celebrating the African American Arts & Cultural District through partnership with SFAAACD</li>
            <li><strong>Education Programs:</strong> Group bike classes and community rides/walks in partnership with Bayview YMCA; Vision Zero Campaign addressing vehicle speeding dangers</li>
            <li><strong>Community Events:</strong> Open Street events along the corridor in partnership with San Francisco African American Arts & Cultural District</li>
            <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Monitor effectiveness of improvements before and after construction, responsive to community definitions of safety</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="project-detail-card">
          <h3>🎯 Project Goals</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Climate Resilience & Green Infrastructure:</strong> Partner with SFPUC to implement bioretention planters, permeable surfaces, and expanded tree canopy for stormwater management, groundwater recharge, and urban cooling—addressing climate change impacts in an environmental justice community</li>
            <li><strong>Respond to Community Priorities:</strong> Address transportation priorities identified in the Bayview Community-Based Transportation Plan through direct community engagement</li>
            <li><strong>Improve Safety:</strong> Address High Injury Network corridors (Third Street and Lane Street) and enhance transportation safety for people walking and biking through traffic calming and infrastructure improvements</li>
            <li><strong>Increase Connectivity:</strong> Provide a low-stress alternative route to Third Street, improving access to community destinations including schools, parks, recreation centers, libraries, healthcare facilities, and grocery stores</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritize Vulnerable Users:</strong> Center mobility outcomes for seniors, youth, and people with disabilities</li>
            <li><strong>Support Community Ownership:</strong> Preserve sense of place and belonging through street markings and murals celebrating the African American Arts & Cultural District</li>
            <li><strong>Build Understanding:</strong> Encourage community use through partnerships with local organizations on walks, rides, bike classes, and open street events</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>⚠️ High Injury Network Context</h3>
          <p>The Bayview Community Pathway directly addresses San Francisco's Vision Zero commitment to eliminate traffic deaths. Third Street and Lane Street are part of the city's <strong>High Injury Network</strong> - just 12% of San Francisco streets where 68% of severe and fatal traffic injuries occur.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">By creating a safer parallel route and implementing traffic calming measures, this project responds to urgent community safety needs in a neighborhood that has historically faced disproportionate transportation safety challenges.</p>
