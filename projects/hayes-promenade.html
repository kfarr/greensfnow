          <h3>✨ Success Story: From Activation to Permanence</h3>
          <p>Since 2020, Hayes Promenade has demonstrated remarkable success as a weekend street closure program:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>27 major activations in the past year</strong> featuring diverse programming including music, dance, arts, and community events</li>
            <li><strong>76 smaller activations in the past year</strong> bringing consistent neighborhood vitality</li>
            <li><strong>Strong merchant support</strong> due to increased foot traffic and outdoor dining opportunities</li>
            <li><strong>Community building</strong> through regular gathering opportunities that strengthen neighborhood bonds</li>
            <li><strong>Proven model</strong> for what city streets can become when prioritizing people over cars</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This track record provides compelling evidence for making the transformation permanent. As one advocate noted, "Nobody's a big fan of it's closed two days a week, it's open two days a week... we want something that looks more like what these [permanent plaza] projects are doing."</p>

      const emailBody = `Dear Mayor Lurie, Supervisor Preston, and City agency staff,

As a resident of San Francisco, I'm writing to express my strong support for Hayes Promenade and its transformation from a successful weekend activation program into a permanent pedestrian plaza and open green space in Hayes Valley.

Since 2020, Hayes Promenade has demonstrated remarkable success with 27 major activations and 76 smaller activations, proving what city streets can be when we prioritize people over cars. Children play safely, neighbors and visitors gather and shop, artists and musicians perform, and local businesses thrive with increased foot traffic and outdoor dining opportunities.

The benefits are clear and compelling:
• Safe, vibrant community space in the heart of Hayes Valley
• Strong support from local merchants who benefit from consistent pedestrian activity
• Cultural programming that strengthens neighborhood bonds
• A proven model over multiple years of successful weekend activations
• Integration with recently passed Entertainment Zone legislation
• Opportunity for green infrastructure and stormwater management on approximately 1.5 acres

The immediate priority is ensuring permit renewal at the upcoming SFMTA Board meeting to continue the weekend activations. Beyond that, I strongly encourage the city to work with Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association, the Merchants Council, and project advocates to transform this successful temporary program into a permanent pedestrian plaza.

Hayes Promenade represents the future of San Francisco's streets: people-centered, environmentally sustainable, economically vibrant, and community-building. Please support both the permit renewal and the long-term vision for permanent pedestrianization.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,`;
