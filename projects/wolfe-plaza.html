            <strong>Adjacent to:</strong> Wolfe's Lunch Cafe, CCA Campus<br>

            <h3>🌱 Project Overview</h3>
            <p>Wolfe Plaza proposes to close the 8th Street spur between Irwin and 16th Street—a historic vestige of the old street grid from the late 19th and early 20th century railroad network that forms a triangle east of Wolfe's Lunch Cafe. This unusual configuration creates both a safety hazard and an opportunity for transformation.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The project would reclaim this unnecessary street segment and transform it into a green public space with significant opportunities for traffic calming at the 8th/Irwin/Wisconsin intersection through bulbouts and intersection redesign. The space has already proven successful as a former Streets to Parks activation site, demonstrating community support and viability for permanent transformation.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">With potential access to adjacent public right-of-way, the project could encompass close to half an acre, creating a substantial new green space in a neighborhood that lacks open space for residents, students, and local businesses.</p>

          <h3>🎯 Why This Location Needs Action</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Proven Success:</strong> This site was successfully activated through the Streets to Parks program, demonstrating community support and viability for permanent transformation</li>
            <li><strong>Historic Vestige:</strong> The 8th Street spur is an unnecessary remnant of the old street grid from the late 19th and early 20th century railroad network that serves no current transportation function—16th Street is immediately adjacent and serves the same purpose</li>
            <li><strong>Safety Concerns:</strong> The current configuration creates a dangerous intersection at 8th/Irwin/Wisconsin where vehicles can make high-speed turns without stop signs in one direction. CCA has identified this as a particularly dangerous intersection for their students</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of Open Space:</strong> The Showplace Square community, including CCA students and nearby residents, lack accessible green space despite proximity to major destinations and institutions</li>
            <li><strong>CCA Campus Proximity:</strong> Immediately adjacent to CCA's campus, providing opportunities for student participation in activation, outdoor classrooms, and safe gathering spaces</li>
            <li><strong>Expanded Area Potential:</strong> Additional public right-of-way on the northeast parcel could significantly expand the project to create a legitimate park-scale green space</li>
            <li><strong>Stormwater Management:</strong> The large area presents excellent opportunities for stormwater collection and green infrastructure</li>
            <li><strong>Traffic Calming Opportunity:</strong> Closing the street spur enables significant intersection redesign with bulbouts to improve pedestrian safety and reduce the oversized intersection footprint</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-detail-card">
          <h3>🌳 Vision for Potential Uses</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Dog Park / Dog Run:</strong> Potential for a dog park or dog run, especially if adjacent public property is available, helping to alleviate pressure on nearby Jackson Park during its planned renovation</li>
            <li><strong>Community Plaza:</strong> Green plaza with tables and chairs for residents and patrons of Wolfe's Lunch Cafe and other nearby businesses (including restaurants at Potrero 1010)</li>
            <li><strong>CCA Programming:</strong> Potential outdoor classroom space or other activities for CCA students, fostering community-university engagement</li>
            <li><strong>Green Infrastructure:</strong> Stormwater collection and management, permeable surfaces, street trees and plantings</li>
            <li><strong>Traffic Safety Improvements:</strong> Bulbouts at 8th/Irwin/Wisconsin intersection corners to slow traffic, shorten pedestrian crossings, and add greenery</li>
            <li><strong>Event Space:</strong> Flexible space for community events, craft fairs, and neighborhood gatherings (as demonstrated by successful weekend activations)</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="project-detail-card">
          <h3>🚗 Addressing Parking & Access Concerns</h3>
          <p>The project team recognizes that nearby businesses, including Wolfe's Lunch Cafe, may have concerns about parking and access. The vision includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Parking Solutions:</strong> Working with affected businesses to identify appropriate parking solutions, potentially including perpendicular parking on Wisconsin Street or other nearby locations</li>
            <li><strong>Outdoor Seating Opportunities:</strong> Creating new opportunities for outdoor seating and dining that could benefit local restaurants</li>
            <li><strong>Increased Foot Traffic:</strong> Plaza activation typically increases pedestrian activity and business for nearby establishments</li>
            <li><strong>Delivery Access:</strong> Ensuring appropriate accommodation for business deliveries and essential vehicle access</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">These details will be refined through community engagement as the project develops, ensuring that solutions work for all stakeholders while prioritizing public space transformation.</p>

      const emailBody = `Dear Mayor Lurie, Supervisor Dorsey, and City agency staff,

As a resident of San Francisco, I'm writing to express my strong support for the Wolfe Plaza project, which would transform the unnecessary 8th Street spur between Irwin and 16th Street into a permanent green open space serving residents, local businesses, and the CCA university campus.

This historic vestige of the old street grid currently serves no essential transportation function—16th Street immediately adjacent serves the same purpose. Meanwhile, the unusual configuration creates a dangerous intersection that CCA has identified as particularly hazardous for their students.

The Wolfe Plaza project proposes to reclaim this space and create community benefits:
• Safe, accessible outdoor space for CCA students, nearby residents, and local businesses
• Potential dog park or dog run to alleviate pressure on Jackson Park during planned renovations
• Stormwater management infrastructure in an area well-suited for green infrastructure
• Traffic calming improvements with bulbouts at the 8th/Irwin/Wisconsin intersection
• Community plaza space for dining, events, and neighborhood gatherings
• Expansion of green space in Showplace Square, a neighborhood that lacks open space

This location has already proven successful through the Streets to Parks program, demonstrating strong community support for permanent transformation. With potential access to adjacent public right-of-way, the project could create close to half an acre of new green space.

The timing is right to work with project advocates, CCA, local businesses, and Potrero Boosters to ensure this unnecessary street spur becomes a thriving community asset that serves people instead of creating safety hazards.

I encourage you to support the Wolfe Plaza project and work with advocates to transform this space into the green infrastructure our community needs.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,`;
