          <h3>üöß What is an "Unaccepted Street"?</h3>
          <p>An unaccepted street is public right-of-way that exists on paper but has not been formally accepted by the city for maintenance. These streets create unique challenges:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Public but Unmaintained:</strong> The land is public right-of-way, but the city hasn't taken responsibility for upkeep</li>
            <li><strong>Enforcement Gap:</strong> As seen here, DPW's reluctance to enforce against illegal encroachments creates opportunities for private appropriation</li>
            <li><strong>Transformation Opportunity:</strong> Converting unaccepted streets to accepted parkland or green space can resolve ambiguous status</li>
            <li><strong>Community Benefit:</strong> Formalizing these spaces benefits everyone by creating clear ownership, maintenance responsibility, and public access</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The Carolina Triangle represents a clear case where public right-of-way should be reclaimed and transformed into community-serving green infrastructure rather than remaining in legal limbo.</p>

      const emailBody = `Dear Mayor Lurie, Supervisor Walton, and City agency staff,

As a resident of San Francisco, I'm writing to express my strong support for the Carolina Triangle project, which would reclaim illegally occupied public right-of-way at Channel and Carolina Streets and transform it into green infrastructure and community amenities for students and residents of the Showplace Square neighborhood.

Currently, this triangular section of public right-of-way is occupied by illegal encroachments including shacks and abandoned vehicle parking. The area appears to be an "unaccepted street" - public land that the city has not formally maintained, creating an enforcement gap that has allowed private appropriation of public space.

The Carolina Triangle project proposes to resolve this situation by reclaiming the public right-of-way and creating green space that serves multiple community needs:
‚Ä¢ Safe, accessible outdoor space for CCA students in adjacent residential facilities
‚Ä¢ Green amenities for Live Oak School students at their new nearby campus
‚Ä¢ Stormwater management infrastructure in coordination with nearby Mission Channel facilities
‚Ä¢ Community space in a neighborhood that lacks green infrastructure despite proximity to Chase Center and Oracle Park

The timing is critical. With the adjacent Amazon warehouse development moving forward, there is an opportunity to secure improvement fees and coordinate planning to ensure proper access for existing businesses like 100 Hooper while creating meaningful community benefits. DPW has indicated they want to coordinate enforcement with project advocates and the developer, making this a unique moment to resolve the illegal encroachment situation.

This project demonstrates environmental justice in action - converting abandoned, illegally occupied space into community-serving green infrastructure that centers the needs of students and residents who currently lack access to quality outdoor space.

I encourage you to support the Carolina Triangle project and work with project advocates to ensure the adjacent development includes funding and coordination for this essential public space reclamation.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,`;
