            <h3>📍 Location</h3>
            <p><strong>Primary Focus:</strong> Sansome Street between Sutter Street and Bush Street (unit block)<br>
            <strong>Neighborhood:</strong> Financial District, Downtown San Francisco<br>
            <strong>District:</strong> Downtown San Francisco Community Benefit District<br>
            <strong>Transit:</strong> Montgomery Street BART/Muni Metro station entrance at Sutter &amp; Sansome; direct underground BART elevator access via One Sansome Street; served by multiple Muni bus lines</p>
          </div>

          <div class="project-detail-card">
            <h3>🌱 Project Overview</h3>
            <p>Sansome Plaza envisions a single block of Sansome Street reimagined as a sun-drenched, green pedestrian plaza in the heart of the Financial District. The block already draws significant foot traffic from office workers, transit riders, and visitors who naturally congregate here during daytime hours.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">By introducing greenery, flexible seating, and community programming — and potentially reclaiming 1–2 traffic lanes or parking spaces — this project would create a model for how downtown streets can evolve from vehicle throughways into living, breathing public plazas. The property owner has expressed willingness to collaborate on streetscape enhancements.</p>

          <div class="project-detail-card">
            <h3>🏛️ Site Assets</h3>
            <p><strong>One Sansome Street:</strong> The 42-story LEED Platinum office tower anchors the block. Its base features the historic <strong>Conservatory</strong> — a glass-domed privately owned public open space (POPOS) built within the 1910 Anglo &amp; London Paris National Bank building designed by architect Albert Pissis. The Conservatory now houses the Holbrook House restaurant and is available for event rental, with nearly 16,000 sq ft of event space accommodating up to 2,000 guests.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Exceptional Sun Exposure:</strong> The site receives abundant morning and midday sunlight, making it one of the warmest and brightest public zones in the Financial District — ideal for outdoor seating, planting, and year-round use.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>BART/Muni Entrance:</strong> The Montgomery Street Station stairwell and escalator entrance at Sutter &amp; Sansome delivers thousands of commuters daily to this exact location. BART's ongoing Market Street Stations Canopy Project is renovating this entrance with a new canopy, LED lighting, digital displays, and security improvements.</p>

          <h3>🎯 Project Goals</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Green-Up Structures:</strong> Introduce vertical green walls, trellises, or modular planting structures that add vegetation and visual interest without requiring extensive ground-level planting space, framing seating areas and softening the urban hardscape</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible Public Seating:</strong> Install movable tables, chairs, benches, and lounge seating arranged to encourage lingering, socializing, and informal gatherings for both individuals and groups</li>
            <li><strong>Lane Reclamation:</strong> Explore removal or conversion of 1–2 traffic lanes or parking spaces to create expanded pedestrian and gathering space, ranging from temporary weekend closures to potential permanent redesign</li>
            <li><strong>Planting &amp; Tree Canopy:</strong> Add street trees, raised planters with seasonal plantings, and containerized greenery to increase shade, improve air quality, and create a sense of enclosure and comfort</li>
            <li><strong>Community Programming Space:</strong> Designate areas for community outreach events, pop-up markets, performances, informational booths, and neighborhood engagement activities</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Transit Welcome:</strong> Improve the area around the BART/Muni entrance to create a more welcoming arrival experience with wayfinding, greenery, and seating adjacent to the station stairwell</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-detail-card">
          <h3>📋 Alignment with Public Realm Action Plan</h3>
          <p>This project directly advances several core strategies from the <a href="https://downtownsf.org/public-realm-action-plan" target="_blank">Downtown SF Partnership's 2022 Public Realm Action Plan (PRAP)</a>, developed with SITELAB Urban Studio. The PRAP specifically identifies Sansome Street as a priority corridor for creating a continuous pedestrian zone between 1 Bush Street and CitiCorp Plaza.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Expanding Pedestrian Space:</strong> Potential removal of traffic lanes or parking to create wider pedestrian zones with seating and greenery</li>
            <li><strong>Greening the District:</strong> Introduction of planters, trees, green structures, and living elements to a block currently dominated by hardscape</li>
            <li><strong>Activating Existing Public Spaces:</strong> Leveraging the One Sansome Conservatory and adjacent POPOS as anchors for community programming</li>
            <li><strong>Creating Memorable Experiences:</strong> Establishing a welcoming, green destination that draws people to spend time — not just pass through</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="project-detail-card">
          <h3>💡 Why This Site, Why Now</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Proven demand:</strong> People already choose to spend time here — the project builds on existing behavior rather than trying to create activity from scratch</li>
            <li><strong>Sun advantage:</strong> Exceptional morning and midday light makes this one of the few downtown blocks where outdoor greenery and seating will thrive year-round</li>
            <li><strong>Transit connectivity:</strong> Thousands arrive at this exact block every day via BART and Muni — greening the transit arrival experience sends a powerful signal that downtown is evolving</li>
            <li><strong>Willing property owner:</strong> Barker Pacific Group's openness to collaboration — and their $100M+ track record of investment in public-facing amenities at One Sansome — makes this a high-feasibility project</li>
            <li><strong>PRAP alignment:</strong> The site is explicitly called out in the Downtown SF Partnership's Public Realm Action Plan as a priority for pedestrian and public space improvements</li>
            <li><strong>Catalytic potential:</strong> A successful greening of this single block can serve as a proof of concept for broader downtown plaza and greening projects throughout the district</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-detail-card">
          <h3>💰 Potential Funding Sources</h3>
          <p><strong>District Funds:</strong> Downtown SF Community Benefit District assessment revenue, CBD seed funding for public realm projects<br>
          <strong>City Programs:</strong> SFPUC Green Infrastructure Capital Fund, Community Challenge Grant, Mayor's Office economic development funds for downtown revitalization<br>
          <strong>Transportation:</strong> SFMTA capital improvements, coordination with BART's Market Street Stations Canopy &amp; Escalators Project<br>

      const emailBody = `Dear Supervisor Sauter, Mayor Lurie, and City agency staff,

As a resident and/or worker in San Francisco, I'm writing to express my strong support for the Sansome Plaza project — a vision to transform the unit block of Sansome Street between Sutter and Bush into a vibrant, green public gathering space in the heart of the Financial District.

This block is one of downtown's most transit-accessible and sun-rich locations, sitting directly above the Montgomery Street BART/Muni Metro station entrance, adjacent to the historic One Sansome Conservatory, and drawing high daily foot traffic from office workers and visitors. It's an ideal site for demonstrating how downtown streets can evolve to support community life, greenery, and pedestrian comfort.

The project aligns with the Downtown SF Partnership's Public Realm Action Plan, which specifically identifies Sansome Street as a priority for creating a continuous pedestrian zone. By introducing green infrastructure, flexible seating, and community programming — and potentially reclaiming traffic lanes or parking for people — this project can serve as a model for greening the Financial District and creating new public plazas downtown.

I urge city leaders to work with the Downtown Community Benefit District and property owners to advance this project. Potential removal of hardscape and introduction of permeable green space would also support stormwater management goals and improve air quality in one of the city's densest employment centers.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,`;
