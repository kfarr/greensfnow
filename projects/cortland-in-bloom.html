          <h3>üåº What is Light Green Infrastructure?</h3>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This project represents an accessible form of "light green infrastructure"‚Äîlow-cost, flexible interventions that deliver meaningful environmental and safety benefits without major construction. Potted plants provide stormwater absorption, reduce urban heat through evapotranspiration, improve air quality, and create habitat for pollinators. They can be easily moved, maintained by community volunteers, and adapted over time as the neighborhood's needs evolve.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Light green infrastructure like Cortland in Bloom demonstrates how communities can take immediate action to green their streets while building momentum for larger permanent green infrastructure investments. It's a grassroots approach that empowers residents and merchants to become environmental stewards in their own neighborhood.</p>

        <div class="project-detail-card">
          <h3>üö∏ What is Daylighting?</h3>
          <p>Daylighting is the practice of keeping the curb space near intersections clear of visual obstructions like parked cars, making it easier for drivers and pedestrians to see each other. Studies show that daylighting significantly reduces collisions, particularly those involving pedestrians and cyclists. This proven safety measure helps prevent accidents by improving sightlines at the most critical locations where vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists intersect.</p>

          <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Cortland in Bloom uses potted plants as a beautiful and flexible approach to daylighting‚Äîcreating clear sightlines while adding greenery and color to the neighborhood. Unlike traditional painted curbs or bollards, plants provide a welcoming aesthetic that builds community support for safety improvements. This approach combines proven safety measures with community beautification, turning necessary safety infrastructure into neighborhood assets that build community pride and connection.</p>

      const emailBody = `Dear Mayor Lurie, Supervisors Fielder and Ferrigno, and City agency staff,

As a resident of San Francisco, I'm writing to express my strong support for Cortland in Bloom, a community-led initiative to improve pedestrian safety and beautify Bernal Heights' main business district through strategic daylighting with potted plants.

Cortland in Bloom will place potted plants in daylighting zones at key intersections along Cortland Avenue‚Äîat Elsie, Bonview, and Benington Streets. This approach combines proven safety measures with neighborhood beautification, improving visibility at intersections while creating a more vibrant and welcoming commercial corridor.

Daylighting is a proven safety measure that reduces collisions by improving sightlines between drivers and pedestrians. By using potted plants instead of traditional painted curbs or bollards, this project transforms necessary safety infrastructure into beautiful community assets that build neighborhood pride and engagement.

This grassroots initiative aligns perfectly with San Francisco's Vision Zero goals, our commitment to livable neighborhoods, and the city's climate and greening objectives. The project is being led by dedicated community advocates working with Safe Streets Bernal, with support from SFMTA, Sierra Club, and more local community organizations.

I encourage you to support Cortland in Bloom and work with the project stewards to move this important safety and beautification initiative forward. The Bernal Heights community deserves safer streets and more vibrant public spaces.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,`;
